Welcome to Psychopy 101

Psychopy is a free software package written in the Python programming language for creating and running cognitive/psychophysics experiments.  This introductory class is aimed at beginners and does not require any programming experience.

Setting up
-

An experiment within the fields of experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience is a task designed to assess how we perceive and process specific types of information. Experimenters often **deliver information** and **collect response** to measure and analyse.


**Building an experiment with Psychopy**
-
In Psychopy, an experiment is like a movie which contains individual scenes and sets. Just like a movie a Psychopy experiment is made up of scenes called **Routines** which are contained within a timeline called **Flow**. 

We add a new scene by clicking on **Insert Routine**, naming our new routine then selecting where on the timeline we'd like it to be by clicking on the black dot.

<img src="./gui_shots/new.png" style="width: 60px;"/> <img src="./gui_shots/name.png" style="width: 90px;"/> <img src="./gui_shots/insert.png" style="width: 80px;"/>

Each scene comes with its own working window that has its own timeline.

<img src="./gui_shots/scene1.png" style="width: 405px;"/> 


Within each scene, we add items such as text, shapes, images, video and audio, which we can choose from the list of **Components** on the right side. The properties window that appears when we click on a component allows us to input things like duration, location, size and colour of the item we are adding to our scene. One of the most important features is adjusting the starting time and duration of the item.  We can either input how long we want the item to be displayed, or leave the duration blank (which means infinite) and add keyboard response so that it remains on the screen until the participants respond by pressing a designated key on the keyboard.


<img src="./gui_shots/components.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 150px;"/> <img src="./gui_shots/properties.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/>

Now let us start building an experiment what contains an instruction, a stimulus and a thank you section.

Insert Routine > new > 'Instruction'

Insert Routine > new > 'Stimulus'

Insert Routine > new > 'Thank you'

<img src="./gui_shots/experiment.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>

Once we have our scenes outlined, we can click on the first scene which is out **Instruction** and select the text icon from the **Components** on the right.  Here we can add our instruction for what we would like participants to do.  For example:

"Press the spacebar to start task."

And we click on the keyboard icon on the right to add a keyboard response.  Remember to make the duration of the instruction text infinite so that the text remains on the screen until the spacebar is pressed.  

<img src="./gui_shots/instruct.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>

Next... we will add our stimulus.

Looping through conditions
-

Now that we have our movie structure:

![Paradigm structure](./gui_shots/Flow.png)

We can add the movie's scene components.

Click on *Stimulus* in the **Flow** to open the scene, then click <img src="./gui_shots/image.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 30px;"/> in the **Components** panel.  
A box pops up with several options for the image. Notice the default duration of an image is 1 second.

In the *Image* dialoge box, we need tell *Psychopy* where to look for this component of the scene.  
In your *Psychopy* folder, there is a subdirectory called *'images'*. This subdirectory holds images that can be used in for this scene. Lets use the cat_eyes.jpeg file. In the *Image* dialoge box, enter the path to the file like so:  
![image path](./gui_shots/image_path1.png)
Click OK

We can test to see if this works by running the movie. Click the Run icon <img src="./gui_shots/run.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 20px;"/> on the top right of the *Psychopy* window. Enter '001' as the participant number.

In your *Psychopy* directory, you will now see a *'data'* subdirectory with the data saved in the form of 001_filename_date.csv. We will discuss the contents of the .csv later.

The movie works, but usually there are many scenes in a movie, and in psychological experiments the scene is often repeated.

In the **Flow**, click the *Insert Loop* button.
Click the first dot immediately following *Stimulus* and the second dot immediately before it. A dialog box apears with several options. Name it 'trials', the stimulus will loop 5 times by default.  
Run <img src="./gui_shots/run.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 20px;"/> the experiment again.

You will have noticed that there was only one presentation of the kitten scene, any idea why? The kitten scene was actually presented for 1 second, 5 times, but there was no gap between the scenes. 

An interstimulus interval (ISI) is required to separate each scene. In the **Components** panel, click *Custom* then the <img src="./gui_shots/ISI_button.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 30px;"/>. The default ISI is 0.5 seconds. Click OK, there is now a pink shaded area for 0.5 seconds.  
Put the ISI before the image by changing the start time of the <img src="./gui_shots/image.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 30px;"/> to 0.5 and the duration to 1.0. 
![image path](./gui_shots/ISI.png)
Run <img src="./gui_shots/run.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 20px;"/> the movie again.

So we have 5 scene presentations, but what about recording a response? Let's add a button press for reaction time and accuracy.  
Click on the <img src="./gui_shots/keyboard.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 30px;"/> in the **Components** panel. There are several options again, type 'space' into the *Allowed keys* box to indicate a response by spacebar press. Click OK and the key response appears in the workspace.

Click again on the <img src="./gui_shots/image.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 30px;"/> in the scene, and change the duration of the image to 0. Now the picture will be presented until the spacebar is pressed.

![image path](./gui_shots/stim_complete.png)

We now have instructions and a scene that flashes for 1 second 5 times, and we can record a response. Click <img src="./gui_shots/run.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 20px;"/>

Lets check out the data.
 
This is good, but we can also loop through different scenes. 

Let's use a new example. Imagine that *Psychopy* is in the pizza delivery business.  
*Psychopy* needs to collect the pizza order and deliver it to the customer, then receive the money. *Psychopy* looks at the list of pizzas to be delivered, and delivers each in turn until there are no more. Similarly, *Psychopy* can collect an image from a list, deliver it to the participant, and then receives a response, continuing until the list is done.

This list can be saved to an excel spreadsheet. In your *images* subdirectory, there is a file called datafile.xlsx. This contains a ready-made list.

![properties icon](./gui_shots/spreadsheet.png)

Like the path we entered to the kitten image earlier, the column *images* has a list of paths to images.  
There are additional columns in the spreadsheet, in the pizza example, these can be thought of as the drink and a dessert that accompany the pizza. The drink and dessert in each row are specific to the pizza in that row.

Lets set it up. In this example we will use images of gorillas, kittens and hedgehogs. The instructions are:

*You will see pictures*

*Press left for gorillas*  
*Press right for kittens*  
*Press up for hedgehogs*

*Press spacebar to continue*

Click on *Instructions* in the **Flow**, and select <img src="./gui_shots/text.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 30px;"/>. Type the above into the *Text* box.

To tell *Psychopy* where to look for the datafile, click on *trials* in the **Flow** and select *Browse...*. Select the datafile.xlsx and hit OK. The path to the file is now in the dialog box, and below there will be a summary of what is included. In this spreadsheet there are 10 rows (conditions) with 3 columns (parameters) as shown below.

![properties icon](./gui_shots/loop_prop.png)

Now, to tell *Psychopy* to deliver the images from this list, click on *Stimulus* in the **Flow**, and the <img src="./gui_shots/image.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 30px;"/>. In the *Image* box, type '\$images'. The \$ tells *Psychopy* to look for the column called *images* in the excel spreadsheet. Change the associated dropdown box to *set every repeat*. The image Properties should look like this:  
![properties icon](./gui_shots/image_prop.png)
Click OK.

We now need to record the amount of money received following pizza delivery, or the button press recieved following the image delivery. Click the <img src="./gui_shots/keyboard.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 30px;"/> and type ' 'left', 'right', 'up' ' into *Allowed keys*. In the *Store* dropdown, select *first key*. Finally, click the box to *Store correct* and enter '\$correct_ ans' in the *Correct answer* box. As with the image properties, this tells *PsychoPy* to look in the correct_ans column in the excel spreadsheet. Your Properties should resemble the image below.

![properties icon](./gui_shots/cor_ans.png)

Your scene should now look like this:

![image path](./gui_shots/stim_complete.png)

Let's do it! Click <img src="./gui_shots/run.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 20px;"/>
